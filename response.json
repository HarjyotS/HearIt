        "speaker_id": "GUEST",
        "text": "Thanks for having me. Excited to talk about Roblox, it’s a fascinating platform with a lot going on."

      {
        "speaker_id": "HOST",
        "text": "Let's start at the beginning. Roblox isn’t just a single game, right? It’s more of a community?"
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "GUEST",
        "text": "Exactly. Roblox is a platform that allows users to create their own games using its Roblox Studio engine. It’s massively multiplayer and lets players create, share, and enjoy games made by others, fueled by a virtual currency called Robux."
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "HOST",
        "text": "It sounds like it gives a lot of power to its users. How does Roblox handle security and content moderation?"
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "GUEST",
        "text": "Security is a big challenge. Roblox has faced criticism for how it handles moderation and the safety of younger players. They've attempted to curb this with a human moderation team and automated systems, but challenges persist with inappropriate content slipping through."
      },
      {
aria "speaker_id": "HOST",
        "text": "I see. And with any platform that involves money and user-generated content, there must be concerns about exploitation?"
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "GUEST",
        "text": "Absolutely. There have been numerous reports and criticisms about how Roblox handles transactions and the potential for young developers to be exploited due to the lack of transparency in how profits are shared and the high cuts taken by the platform."
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "HOST",
        "cmp": "
Sure, that raises concerns about consumer protection. But amidst these issues, Roblox has been a launchpad for creativity as well, right?"
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "GUEST",
        "cover_text": "Definitely. Despite the challenges, many see Roblox as a valuable tool for learning coding and digital art. Schools are even incorporating it into their curriculum to help students learn game design and programming."
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "HOST",
        "text": "That's quite impactful. John, how do you see the future of Roblox?"
      },
      {
        "speaker_id": "GUEST",
        "text": "Roblox is continuing to grow and expand its features, focusing on things like better AI for moderation and even exploring educational content. If they can address the safety and ethical concerns, it has a huge potential to be an even more significant player in not just gaming, but in educational circles too."
